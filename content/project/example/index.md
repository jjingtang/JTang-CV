Presentation is an essential skill for most of the individuals no matter in the academic field or normal life. However, public speaking anxiety is a common issue (Poeschl, 2017). According to the American Psychiatric Association (2013), the anxiety of public speaking is classified as a form of social anxiety disorder which has the number of F40.1 under Anxiety Disorders. Research has shown that individuals with public speaking anxiety fear the audience would criticise or humiliate them during the speech. These people would avoid public speaking; otherwise, their heart rate and blood pressure will significantly increase when they appear in front of the audiences (Nazligul, 2018, p. 2). If this kind of symptom is ignored and persevered, it is likely to develop into more serious psychological problems such as social anxiety and depression. It could also lead to more negative influences in normal life, for instance, lower levels of education and a higher risk of unemployment (Chesham, Malouff and Schutte, 2018). Chesham, Malouff and Schutte (2018) also point out that although public speaking anxiety has these harmful impacts, only a small number of individuals seek professional help.

Additionally, research suggests cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) is commonly used in face-to-face therapy with a response rate range between 80%-90% for public speaking anxiety (Koller et al., 2019). Exposure is a critical component of CBT along with other tools such as cognitive restructuring, social skills training and relaxation training (Chesham, Malouff and Schutte, 2018).

Meanwhile, Virtual Reality (VR) technology as a tool shows high valuable potential combining with exposure therapy for treating public speaking anxiety. VR blocks the users from what they saw in real life and replaces it with experience in a computer-generated three-dimensional (3D) world. Instead of imaging a classroom with a few students listening to the presentation, the user can actually move around within the computer-generated virtual classroom, see and interact with the virtual audiences. The participants would practice presentations in this classroom to manage the anxiety and stress level while the avatars would play a significant role to deliver the exposure therapy training and provide the (phobic) stimulus (Koller et al., 2019).
