The pandemic has changed individuals‘ lifestyle. To adopt a world-wide lockdown, the traditional ways of face-to-face working and learning has imperceptibly changed. However, university has kept laboratory open during the pandemic for scholars to contiune studying. It seems unsafe in this high-tect modern world. 

Meanwhile, virtual reality (VR) could provide an immersed experience for educational purpose. VR programs can be accessed without geographical limitations, which could be a highly potential solution to this particular issue. 

This study shall delivere a Virtual Reality chemisty lab system made by Unity.
