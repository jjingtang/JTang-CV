**Overview:**

The award-winning project, CONNECT, emerged victorious at the recent hackathon event, showcasing its innovative approach to addressing communication challenges at Canberra Hospital. This groundbreaking VR application aims to enhance collaboration and information flow among hospital staff, incorporating valuable insights from both Canberra Hospital professionals and teaching experts from the University of Canberra.

Canberra Hospital faced a pressing issue of insufficient interprofessional communication among its diverse staff (including Doctors, Nurses, Pharmacists, Physios), leading to potential lapses in information sharing, especially concerning rookie training. Recognising this challenge, the CONNECT team embarked on a mission to revolutionise communication within the hospital environment.

Collaboration and Information Gathering:

The CONNECT team engaged with staff members from Canberra Hospital and teaching crew from the University of Canberra, conducting extensive interviews to understand the specific pain points in interprofessional communication. This collaborative effort allowed the team to gain a comprehensive understanding of the challenges faced by both seasoned professionals and newcomers in the healthcare industry.

Immersive Training Modules: A series of interactive VR training modules designed for newcomers training, providing a simulated environment to familiarise them with communication with colleagues.

Virtual Meetings: Conduct pre-surgery meetings in a virtual space, facilitating  interaction and communication among all related staffs including doctors, nurses, pharmacists and physios, and simulate the best treatment plan for any patients.

User-Friendly Interface: The application boasts an intuitive and user-friendly design, ensuring accessibility for all staff members, regardless of their technical proficiency.

Prototype:

The team meticulously delivered a presentation to visually demonstrating the UI of the application, functionalities, and user flow at the end of the event. This prototype served as a tangible guide for further development and provided a hands-on experience for stakeholders to grasp the potential impact of CONNECT.

Outcome:

The success of CONNECT was evident as it clinched the 1st place at the hackathon event, acknowledging its potential to transform communication practices within Canberra Hospital. The project not only offers a solution to the immediate challenges faced by the hospital but also sets a precedent for innovative approaches to communication in healthcare settings.
